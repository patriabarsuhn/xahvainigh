Hi guys, figured someone here might have a better idea on how to troubleshoot this one than I do. I was stoked to learn I could run this on my Xbox earlier this week, consolidating my HTPC into the Xbox is just fantastic. But I'm suffering from one persistent issue. Nearly every file plays without issue. Big files or small. Format doesn't seem to be the problem, MPEG or MKV seem to be fine. The issue is it struggles to play videos that I happened to rip from a blu-ray disc myself. Every single. Помимо этого, mkv обеспечивает трансляцию в онлайн-режиме, моментальную перемотку файла и разбиение файла на главы. MPEG (англ. Moving Picture Experts Group; произносится «эмпэг» — рус.

I plan on using mostly for YouTube TV, Netflix and YouTube. But also for locally hosted video content, through Plex/Kodi unless someone has another suggestion. I'm cutting the cord and bumping my internet speed up to 500Mbps/50Mbps. 1Gbps/50Mbps is also an option, but all TV's are still 1080p so 500 should be more than enough. I plan on using an external USB 3.0 1TB drive connected to my new wifi router (Linksys WRT AC3200, went big, when it was on sale) for local media storage. I also ordere.

If this question would be more appropriate in another reddit, please let me know. I'm trying to get several avi files to play on my lg bd390 blu-ray player, but the audio isn't working properly on them (it will play for a second and then cuts out while video playback continues). I suspect that the audio bitrate being too high may be the problem. The manual says it supports up to 320 kbs but mediacoder (the only program I knew of that would show me information about the files) says the bitrate.

So, my question is : How to Stream/Transfer DVD ISO files to Chromecast ? Chrome browser only can support WebM, MP4, MPEG and MKV format videos so far. For our Blu-ray/DVD collections, it’s difficult that they can be casted directly from computer to TV via Chromecast. At this stage, what users can do now is to convert Blu-ray/DVD/ISO/IFO to MP4 and use the Chromecast's local playback workaround to stream the movies to Chromecast. If you're looking for ease-to-use, check out Brorsoft's Blu-ray. We are looking for someone to develop a simple baseline application to build the rest of an application off of. The application is intended to stream video from one person’s computer to another’s. We are a small team of developers, and intend to use this baseline application to develop on further. On that same note, assuming everything goes well, we may choose to offer the a long term role within our team. We are looking at a budget of 0 (USD), but are willing to negotiate. We prefer someone. Okay I recently bought the TCL 65" E5691 Series 4K Ultra HD You know how they always have 4K test videos playing on these things in the store? Is there a way to put the TV in a test mode or is there a compatible 4K test video I can put on my USB and play on the TV? Please send me any recommendations I have a PS4 and a 4k ready HDMI cable too. Supported video formats for USB playback: I bought a tv for the sole purpose of watching files from a usb key. The manual and box specify that my tv supports the following:mpg, mpeg, vob, mkv, avi. I have only get mkv and avi and it wont play either. It just says unsupported format. Can anyone recommend a quick fix without me having to take the tv back for a different one. One solution my be to run them through my xbox as that seems to work, however I would rather not have to do it this way. Thanks for any replys Update 1: Just tried. Hey reddit, I've been a member and a creeper on reddit long enough to know that a ton of you out there are awesome with video editing and what not. I know it's a bit of a long shot, but I was hoping to ask for your help. Could anybody out there provide me with information/advice/tips/guide/steps/whatever specifically on being able to take videos streamed from websites, like youtube, or from a file (like a mpeg or mkv?) and take specific scenes or a particular Hey, I have something I acquired from a Microsoft promotion and got a season of a TV show for free on Amazon Video and I'd like to rip it because it's in SD at a DVD bitrate, but I downloaded the encrypted video and it says it uses h264 and not Mpeg 2, so I'm thinking it would look extra crisp compared to DVDs, so I'd like to rip the files and just have them decrypted and not just screen capped, direct descrambling.

Hey everybody, I have a big problem, I need to convert several WebMs back into a format I can use, mainly keeping the Alpha Channel from the files intact, maybe a PNG Sequence or a MOV in Animation or ProRes Codec, but I don't know how, I have WinFF which I use to get my MOVs to WebMs but I don't know how to do the reverse, I have Handbrake which only converts to MKV or MP4 and I have MPEG Streamclip which doesn't help at all does anybody 
I am using the following command to encode a remux: ffmpeg -i "input.mkv" -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:v libx265 -crf 20 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 384k -af "channelmap=channel_layout=5.1" output.mkv This is the mediainfo of the resulting file: Format : Matroska Format version : Version 4 File size : 2.26 GiB Duration : 1 h 1 min Overall Most libraries will allow you to rent CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays from their collection. All you have to do is rent a few discs, pop them in, and rip them. amp#x200B; Here are the methods for ripping books and discs: amp#x200B; For books I'm not sure, if it's a paperback copy you could use something like CamScanner (mobile) to scan pages of the book, but it does take a while (you have to scan every page). I haven't done this but it's worth a shot. amp#x200B; A lot of YouTube videos I’m downloading are VP9. How does VP9 compare to H264? Will a 150 megabyte VP9 file look as good as a 800 megabyte H264 file? Also I have several seasons of unsolved mysteries which is my favorite show that were originally in standard definition so I plugged a Roku with RCA outputs into my DVD Recorder and with the help of a video stabilizer was able to record them off Prime Video. I recorded them in XP mode off my Panasonic DVD Recorder and then ripped I'm using software called Adapter from Macroplant to convery videos from MKV to MP4 so I can play them on my PS4. The videos are originating from YouTube. The file that YouTube wants to give me is 4K - MKV - VP9 - Vorbis and it's 442.8 MB. I need to convert it to H.264 or MPEG-4 High Profile Level 4.2 with audio either MP3, AAC LC, or AC-3. For whatever reason, when I convert using ffmpeg, I get this error. --- ffmpeg version N-56793-g01e3340 Copyright (c) 2000-2013 the FFmpeg developers.
