On the surface it might seem like 1408 is your typical supernatural horror movie, but there is so much more to it. This movie takes us through an emotional roller coaster as John Cusack's character descends into the nine circles of hell. It is one of the deepest, most carefully executed horror films I have ever seen. There are minimal jump scares, and it is surprisingly visceral. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror. 
TL;DR John Cusack plays Mike Enslin - a bitter, charlatan writer who documents his "paranormal experiences" in his novels. Towards the film's climax, Mike stands in the ruined room he had thought himself escaped from, and is presented with the illusion of his daughter, who had passed away from cancer some years prior. The room shows her to Mr. Enslin, to tantalize and torment him. To drive him over the edge by showing him what he has lost. It mocked him by shoving into his face the source. For whatever reason, that movie for me is 1408. I'm not scared of many things, not many things 'creep' me out. But ever since I saw this movie twice maybe 6 years ago, I haven't been able to watch it again. Idk what it is about the movie that makes me that scared of it. But even when I think about some of the scenes ie: guy across the street in the window (#spoiler), my body involuntarily just sends chills down my spine. Even now. I first saw the movie in a TV production class and I really. I haven't seen it in a while, but I remember it being. Obvious spoilers ahead. So, I just watched the movie for the first time, and the multiple references to Dante’s Inferno have stuck with me, and I think I noticed a really cool detail about the film. In the movie, the protagonist, Mike, compares the hotel room to the various circles of hell. It’s important to remember that in the film, Mike has spoken out about God and Religion numerous times. At one point, if I remember right (I might be wrong on this part, I’m half asleep) he mentions. It has some really effective storytelling moments like the white door (possibly Dark Tower reference?), and the room resurrecting his daughter for kicks. ("It won't let me stay.") John Cusack's display of grief at losing his daughter for a second time -- his sheer disbelief and rage when 1408 turns on the radio again and makes his daughter's body turn to charred remains, is genuinely good stuff. Dude is acting the shit out of this material. And once the first loop completes, the film subtly. I just watched it again the other night and I've always enjoyed it. (It's streaming on Netflix/Sweden) The idea of "an evil fucking room" as Samuel Jackson's character puts it, the pacing, the screenplay, are all totally solid. Any other fans of "1408?" It's worth a watch if you've never And I'm not talking about best hotel horror or best Stephen King lists, but general top-50 or top-100 lists like this (https://www.indiewire.com/2018/10/best-horror-movies-all-time-scary-films-1202012183/4/) and this (https://www.timeout.com/london/film/best-horror-films) and this (https://filmschoolrejects.com/50-best-horror-movies-ever/) and this (https://film.avclub.com/the-25-best-horror-movies-since-2000-1798285725) that claim to name the best of all time (or since I'm looking for something to watch from the last few years where the main character/characters are investigating the horror, not just being tormented by it. And I don't mean that they are only investigating in order to survive a situation, because a lot of movies would probably fall under that. More that they wanted to investigate before they were affected by the horror themselves. Like The Autopsy of Jane Doe, or The Ring, or TrollHunter. Three of my favourites, there. 
Finally! I had pieces of this movie stuck in my head since I was 8 years old and I could never remember what I was watching. Somehow I was able to track it down. It's not the greatest movie. But because I was able to remember it for the last 28 years, I think it's worth the watch. amp#x200B; That one guy Billy in the parking lot - talking about history repeating itself. subconsciously I started wearing a green army style jacket and oxblood Dr Martens, weird how little brains process. This guy is insane, currently sitting at 1408 LP Curious what peak number he might reach in the following days/weeks What’s the highest LP currently around the globe. For those who haven't seen the movie, 1408 is about a paranormal investigator/writer who enters a hotel room numbered 1408. 1408 is a room that could most readily be described as an eldritch horror itself in that it can warp reality, time and space. Nobody has ever survived one hour in this room without dying or killing themselves in some way. It gives you one hour to survive in where it will attempt to psychologically break you and horrify you to the point of insanity and suicide. If you survi. Can someone (or something) please explain to me what Erdogan means when he mentions 2023 in every single speech?, This whole thing doesn't make much sense to me. Are Syrians gonna vote for him or something?. Is there any Stephen king short stories you wish were full length books for me I wish graveyard shift, sun dog, the langoliers, and the cat from hell. We're full books and not just short stories what about you guys try not to go into spoilers. </p>
